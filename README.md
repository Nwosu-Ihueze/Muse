**Features**

Rent out music NFT without transferring ownership

Rent out one NFT to multiple users

### Background

NFTs has evolved over the years and has seen a wider range of acceptance from pictures to gaming avatars to videos and music. This acceptance has seen these assets being traded in marketplaces across different blockchains. It has also opened up an opportunity to creatives especially those in the music industry to showcase their music through sells, eliminating middlemen.

### Problem

The welcomed development of creatives getting paid for their music as NFTs through sales and royalty is still having a missing piece - the inability to rent out their music for a specific fee and a period of time without transferring the ownership of their work.

### Solution

We decided to provide this missing piece through Muse. Our smart contract saw the implementation of the ERC4610 which inherits most of ERC721, but eliminating some of the features which hinders effective rental capabilities. The features of the ERC4610 includes not transferring the ownership of your music NFT and also the ability to rent out one music NFT to many people at the same time.
